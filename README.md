# BooleanLoopsDemo

## Project Overview
BooleanLoopsDemo is a simple C# console application designed to demonstrate the usage of boolean comparisons in `while` and `do-while` loops. This application prints out messages based on the conditions set within these loops, illustrating the control flow of each loop type.

## Features
- **While Loop**: Demonstrates how a `while` loop can execute based on a boolean condition.
- **Do-While Loop**: Shows the guaranteed execution of the `do-while` loop at least once, regardless of the boolean condition.
